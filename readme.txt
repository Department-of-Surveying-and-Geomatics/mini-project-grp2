This Python script performs geospatial analysis on traverse data. 

Functionalities:

Data Parsing (dataParsing function):

Reads traverse data from a traverse_data.csv file.

-processes and extract datafrom various sources such as file in this case csv file .

Traverse Analysis.py :

- Contains functions that calculates thedistance and bearing between consecutive points in the traverse data csv.

Plotting.py:
- Contains functions for visualizing traverse data using python package Matplotlib.
-Generates a scatter plot representing the traverse  data points .
-matplotlib is used for creating static and interactive plots.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) (main
-allow users to interact with the program using the Tkinter library , allowing them to select the traverse data file and initiate analysis,widget management, and visualization by arranging visiual elements in a logical and aesthetically pleasing way

Creates a user-friendly interface for interacting with the script. This likely includes functionalities for selecting the data file and visualizing the results.

To use the tool:
- Run main.py and follow the instructions on the GUI.
- Ensure that Python and the required libraries (Tkinter, Matplotlib) are installed on your system.
